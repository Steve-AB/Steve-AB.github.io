          <h2>What is HTML!</h2>
          <P>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is used to describe the visual appearance of a document that can be displayed by an internet browser. An HTML document will consist of certain document tags which describe the visual appearance of a web page or to provide a direct command such as inserting images or links to other web pages within a document. HTML documents are saved in a text format and are designed to be viewed or edited on operating systems that are able to connect to the Internet. XHTML refers to the latest version(s) of the HTML definition that are designed to make use of the extensible markup language definition rules and syntax in order to permit web developers to continue to do advanced web page development.</P>
          <H3>Required Parts of an HTML Page</H3>
          <P>HTML documents are made by using opening and closing tags. A closing tag will have the same name as an opening tag, but should be preceded by the / symbol. All HTML documents must have HTML and BODY tags in order to be displayed in a web browser. Other tags that are common to HTML pages include the document HEAD, TITLE, Headings and Paragraph tags. For example:</P>
          <code>
           <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Page Heading</h1>
<p>My First Web Page paragraph</p>
</body>
<footer>Copyright</footer>
</html>
          </code>
